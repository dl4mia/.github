Welcome to the EMBO-DL4MIA 2024 organization page. ðŸŽ‰

This 2024 edition of the HT course DL4MIA will be organised in-person at Human Technopole (Milan, Italy) with the contribution of the European Molecular Biology Organisation (EMBO).

The goal of the EMBO-DL4MIA Practical Course is to familiarise researchers working in the life sciences with state-of-the-art DL techniques for microscopy image analysis, including (but not limited to) image restoration, segmentation, translation, registration, and tracking.

The training activity will be a full-immersion in the field, with pre-course fundamentals, on-site lectures, tutorials, hands-on projects, and networking events distribute over the course duration.

In the first five days, participants will learn deep learning fundamentals and applications through lectures and exercises led by experts in bioimage analysis, supported by international young scientists as instructors.

During the last four days, participants will work in teams, guided by the course instructors, to solve real image analysis challenges using their own microscopy data. This experience will enable them to apply their newly acquired skills in their own research settings.
